# Contribution Guidelines 👩‍💻👨‍💻

You are free to commit your codes in C++, Java or Python. You can:
- Reporting a bug
- Discuss the current state of the code
- Submit a fix
- Propose new features
- Upload documentations or notes of a specific subject

## Steps to contribute

* Comment on the issue you want to work on. Make sure it's not assigned to someone else.

* If you think an algorithm is missing, create an issue.

### Making a PR

> - Make sure you have been assigned the issue to which you are making a PR.
> - If you make PR before being assigned, It will be labeled `invalid` and closed without merging.

* Fork the repo and clone it on your machine.
* Add a upstream link to main branch in your cloned repo
    ```
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/bhumikatewary/Practice-Problems.git
    ```
* Keep your cloned repo upto date by pulling from upstream (this will also avoid any merge conflicts while committing new changes)
    ```
    git pull upstream master
    ```
* Create your feature branch
    ```
    git checkout -b <feature-name>
    ```
* Commit all the changes
    ```
    git commit -am "Meaningful commit message"
    ```
* Push the changes for review
    ```
    git push origin <branch-name>
    ```
* Create a PR from the repo on Github.
